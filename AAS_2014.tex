\block[c,width=0.7\textwidth]{Abstract}{
We investigate gravitationally focused wind accretion in binary systems
consisting of an evolved star with a gaseous envelope and a compact
accreting companion.  We study the mass accretion and formation of an
accretion disk around the secondary caused by the strong wind from the
primary late-type component using global 2D and 3D hydrodynamic
numerical simulations.  In particular, the dependence on the mass
accretion rate on the  mass loss rate, wind temperature and orbital
parameters of the system is considered.  For a typical slow and massive
wind from an evolved star the mass transfer through a focused wind
results in rapid infall onto the secondary. A stream flow is created
between the stars with accretion rates of a 2-10\% percent of the mass
loss from the primary.  This mechanism could be an important method for
explaining periodic modulations in the accretion rates for a broad range
of interacting binary systems and fueling of a large population of X-ray
binary systems.  We test the plausibility of these accretion flows
indicated by the simulations by comparing with observations of the
symbiotic variable system CH Cyg.

\block{Symbiotic binaries}{
Symbiotic binaries are unique astrophysical laboratories for studies
of wind accretion because of the wide separation of the components, and
the ability to study the individual components and the accretion
processes from multiwavelength studies from X-ray to radio
\citep[e.g.,][]{2010ApJ...710L.132K}.  A typical symbiotic consists of a
mass-losing AGB or a red giant star and a hot accreting companion, often a
white dwarf (WD).  The components in these systems are assumed to be detached
(at least during most of the orbital motion) and the compact companion accretes
mass from the massive wind of the cool evolved star.
}

\block{Numerical model}{
The numerical model is based on previous two-dimensional models
described in \citet{2009ApJ...700.1148D}, hereafter referred to as
\citetalias{2009ApJ...700.1148D}.
We solve the basic equations of hydrodynamics describing the evolution
of the density and velocity field in three-dimensions:
\begin{align}
  \frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{v}) & = 0,\\
  \frac{\partial\mathbf{v}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla )
  \mathbf{v} & = - \frac{1}{\rho}\nabla p - \nabla \Phi,
  \label{eq:NS}
\end{align}
where $\rho$ is the density in the orbital plane, $\mathbf{v}$ the
velocity of the fluid, $p$ the pressure and $\Phi$ the gravitational
potential.

Our code is based on the \flash{} code \citep{2000ApJS..131..273F}, which is a
fully parallel block-structured Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) implementation
of the Piecewise Parabolic Method (PPM) in its original Eulerian
form\footnote{The source code is available at
\url{http://www.flash.uchicago.edu/}}.  The code has been extensively tested in
various compressible flow problems with astrophysical applications.  A
realistic 3D hydrodynamical simulation of the interaction of the wind from a
giant star with a companion using the spherical coordinates version of the code
is under progress. The computational domain spans about one radian around the
orbital plane of the system centered on the primary to cover the whole region
of interest close to the accretor. The resolution per separation in the 3D
simulations is about a factor of two smaller than in the 2D simulations and
leads to the relative damping of the bow shock and spiral structures.
}

\block{Results}{
We present numerical simulations of gravitationally focused wind accretion in
the CH Cyg binary system.  The wind parameters of our model are those of a slow
spherically symmetric wind from an evolved star at the dust acceleration
surface.  A tidal stream is observed in our simulations for a wide range of
binary separations using an isothermal equation of state.  We have considered
simulations with a locally isothermal equation of state.  The results of this
work and a comparison of the models with observations of the symbiotic binary
CH Cyg are summarized below:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The focused wind accretion in this system show a complex dynamics
    that proceeds beyond the accreting companion.
  \item A bow shock and a spiral-like tail structure forms near the position
    of the secondary and on the farther side from the primary  due to the
    supersonic orbital motion.
  \item Mass transfer through a focused wind leads to a stream flow onto the WD
    with variable accretion rates of a $\sim$ 5\% percent of the mass loss
    from the primary.
  \item This mechanism could explain the morphology of the outflows detected in
    the HST and Chandra images of CH Cyg at much larger scales
    \citep{2010ApJ...710L.132K}.
\end{itemize}

We integrate the equations of hydrodynamics until the density distribution of
the gravitationally focused wind reaches a quasi-stationary state.  The
adopted orbital parameters correspond to the symbiotic binary CH~Cyg
\citep[long-period orbit in][shown in the table on the
left]{2009ApJ...692.1360H}.
The stellar wind produced by the donor star is deflected towards the secondary
within the orbital plane, and the relaxed density distributions present
Keplerian accretion disks of various sizes.

The formation of a stream flow is dependent on the wind velocity and
temperature at the dust formation radius which determines the velocity at the
secondary's position.  Our simulations were run on a grid with uniform radial
spacing in our base grid and 5 additional levels of refinement.  The
computational grid was centered on the giant star in the rotating reference
frame of the binary system.  The numerical method changes the accuracy of the
solution by modifying the spacing of the grid points in certain regions while
the system is evolved.  The AMR algorithm places high resolution grid patches
only at the regions where time-dependent shocks are formed.

An HST image of CH Cyg is shown in the left panel of the figure on

approximately the same size of the inner region showed in the simulated image

There is a strikingly similar morphology of the accretion outflow on the
companion and beyond with that of the observed outflow structure at much larger
scales.}
