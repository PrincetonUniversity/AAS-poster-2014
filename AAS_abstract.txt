We investigate the formation of accretion disks around the secondary in
detached systems consisting of an Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) star and
a compact accreting companion as a function of mass loss rate and
orbital parameters. In particular, we study winds from late-type stars
that are gravitationally focused by a companion in a wide binary system
using hydrodynamical simulations. For a typical slow and massive wind
from an evolved star there is a stream flow between the stars with
accretion rates of a few percent of the mass loss from the primary. Mass
transfer through a focused wind is an important mechanism for a broad
range of interacting binary systems and can explain the formation of
chemically peculiar stars.
