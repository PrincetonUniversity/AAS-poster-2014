Investigating mass transfer in symbiotic systems with hydrodynamic simulations

We investigate gravitationally focused wind accretion in binary systems
consisting of an evolved star with a gaseous envelope and a compact accreting
companion.  We study the mass accretion and formation of an accretion disk
around the secondary caused by the strong wind from the primary late-type
component using global 2D and 3D hydrodynamic numerical simulations.  In
particular, the dependence on the mass accretion rate on the  mass loss rate,
wind temperature and orbital parameters of the system is considered.  For a
typical slow and massive wind from an evolved star the mass transfer through a
focused wind results in rapid infall onto the secondary. A stream flow is
created between the stars with accretion rates of a 2-10% percent of the mass
loss from the primary.  This mechanism could be an important method for
explaining periodic modulations in the accretion rates for a broad range of
interacting binary systems and fueling of a large population of X-ray binary
systems.  We test the plausibility of these accretion flows indicated by the
simulations by comparing with observations of the symbiotic CH Cyg variable
system.
